To import Google Sheets into your game:

In your Google Sheets, go to: File > Publish to the Web > Link > CSV
You'll be given a link. Put that link into the "url" field in a "CsvOnlineSource" object in the project structure.

// Example URL
//string url = @"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQGs31fwKF9vuUg9uUOvgN8Jr7bVSQvDILQEMPk6xiKkzk3PDYosuOPMhd0FjrnKPzLkMA998tnZfGN/pub?output=csv"; //Published to the web


Then, using the CsvDownloader and CsvReader class you can easily download and use it in your game as an array of strings.
